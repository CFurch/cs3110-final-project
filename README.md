# COMPAS Recidivism Differentially Private Analysis
Colin Furch and Alex Stute

We plan on examining the impact of differentially private algorithms on the COMPAS Recidivism dataset. 
The problem we intend to solve is effect of DP algorithms on the accuracy of datasets (other than the adult dataset with which we have previously examined).
Our analysis will include implementations of synthetic represenation, as well as comparisons between Zero-Centered, Renyi, and Epsilon-Delta differential privacy.
